description: Apply SOLID principles to improve code structure
---

Review the codebase and apply SOLID principles where appropriate:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
4. **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

Start by identifying the most critical violations and suggest refactoring strategies.
