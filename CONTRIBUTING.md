## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nanocoder.git
   cd nanocoder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Test your setup:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. **For development with auto-rebuild:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Making Changes

### Types of Contributions

1. **Bug Fixes**: Address existing issues or problems
2. **New Features**: Add functionality (new AI providers, tools, commands)
3. **Improvements**: Enhance existing features or performance
4. **Documentation**: Improve README, comments, or guides
5. **Testing**: Add or improve tests
6. **Model Cards**: For our recommendations database

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**

   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add appropriate TypeScript types
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow conventional commits:

- `feat:` - New features
- `mod:` â€“ Smaller modifications to existing features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` - Build process or auxiliary tool changes

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Since Nanocoder is a CLI tool, most testing is currently manual:

1. **Test different AI providers:**

   - Ollama (local)
   - OpenRouter (API)
   - OpenAI-compatible endpoints

2. **Test core functionality:**

   - File operations (read, write, edit)
   - Bash command execution
   - Custom commands
   - MCP server integration

3. **Test error scenarios:**
   - Network failures
   - Invalid configurations
   - Missing dependencies

### Adding Tests

We welcome contributions that add automated testing:

- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for AI providers
- CLI interaction tests

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Strict Mode**: The project uses strict TypeScript settings
- **Types First**: Always define proper TypeScript types
- **No `any`**: Avoid using `any` type; use proper type definitions
- **ESNext**: Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features

### Code Style

- **Formatting**: Code is auto-formatted (maintain existing style)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, not obvious code
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully

### File Organization

- **Imports**: Group external imports, then internal imports
- **Exports**: Use named exports; avoid default exports where possible
- **Modules**: Keep files focused on a single responsibility

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process
